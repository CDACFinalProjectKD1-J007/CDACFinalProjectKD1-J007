## Step 1: Clone the Repository
To begin, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CDACFinalProjectKD1-J007/CDACFinalProjectKD1-J007.git
```

## Step 2: Create a New Branch
Open your terminal and create a new branch. Replace `branch_name` with your desired branch name, such as your name (e.g., `harsh`):
```bash
git checkout -b branch_name
```

## Step 3: Work on Your Branch
Make all your changes within your branch. Use the following commands to stage and commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
```

## Step 4: Prepare to Push Your Changes
Once you are done with your work and ready to push the changes, follow these steps:

1. Switch to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Pull the latest updates from the main branch to ensure you have any new changes made by others:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

## Step 5: Merge Your Branch into the Main Branch
Merge your branch into the main branch:
```bash
git merge branch_name
```

## Step 6: Push Your Changes to the Main Branch
Finally, push the merged changes to the remote repository:
```bash
git push
```
